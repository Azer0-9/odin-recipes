    <h2>description</h2>
    <h4>Saucy, buttered noodles are simple to make and perfect to serve either as-is or alongside steak, chicken, or meatballs. Butter, Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper are all you need for this quick and easy, kid-friendly dish, although fresh herbs and a little lemon juice could be added to amp up the flavor. It's such a delicious recipe, yet I get many questions on how to make it.</h4>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <h4>
        Noodles: This recipe calls for fettuccine noodles, but you could use any noodles you have on hand, from penne to spaghetti.
        Butter: You can use salted or unsalted butter. Since you'll add more salt at the end, you might want to opt for unsalted (depending on your taste, of course).
        Parmesan: Grated Parmesan cheese takes this dish up a notch. Buttered noodles don't technically require cheese, so you can leave it out if you want.
        Salt and Pepper: Finish off this easy buttered noodles recipe with salt and ground black pepper.
