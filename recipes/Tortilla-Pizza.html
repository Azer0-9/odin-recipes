    <h2>description</h2>
    <h4>This tortilla pizza is extremely easy to make. It is light enough to be a snack, serves well as an appetizer, or is so good that it can be devoured alone! You can use any sort of topping variation. The one below is the classic way I usually prepare it but feel free to experiment.</h4>

    <h2>ingredients</h2>
    <h4>

    Tortilla: Use store-bought or homemade soft flour tortillas.
    Oil: Brush the tortillas with olive oil before you season them. 
    Seasonings: These tortilla pizzas are seasoned with garlic powder, black pepper, and dried oregano. 
    Tomato sauce: Use store-bought or homemade tomato sauce. 
    Toppings: Top the tortilla pizzas with sliced chicken breast, green bell pepper, and green onions. Of course, you can customize the toppings to suit your taste. 
    Cheese: Finish the pizzas with mozzarella cheese.
